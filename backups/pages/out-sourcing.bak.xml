Let us demist the cloud for you.  Cloud computing has now matured; it&rsquo;s reliable, secure, cost effective and has the potential to significantly reduce costs, and increase reliability in your business.  It&rsquo;s one of the best IT solutions in ages.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, if you have a social network account with services like Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin you&rsquo;re already using the cloud without knowing it.  All the cloud really means is that your software and data sit remotely on a server in a third party network rather than on a drive in your PC or office based server.  Your access is via a broadband connection, from pretty much any device or location.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You benefit in two key ways.  Firstly is the obvious cost savings; your capex will reduce significantly.  You won&rsquo;t need a server or to cover the costs associated with it such as maintenance, storage space, risk and eventual replacement.  The second is the anywhere, anytime access (see sidebar).  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
The transition can be smooth and seamless.  We&rsquo;re Microsoft Certified Partners, and Microsoft Certified Cloud Partners; our expertise will provide you with IT migration solutions into the cloud in a low-risk, low downtime, low-cost way that you&rsquo;re comfortable with.  
&lt;/p&gt;
